This project aims to provide documentation, configuration samples, scripts and code that allow java developers to use Tomcat as a replacement for "enterprise" servers such as WebSphere Application server, Geronimo, JBoss or Glassfish.

It will show how to configure enterprise development environment  using lightweight open source components:
  * Tomcat as a servlet/web container
  * Atomikos or Bitronix as a JTA transaction manager
  * ActiveMQ as an embedded JMS provider
  * H2/Derby as an embedded database
  * Pluto as an embedded portlet container

Go to [Configuration](Configuration.md).
